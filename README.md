"Living off the land binaries" (LOLBins) are legitimate system or software utilities that can be used in a malicious way by attackers. These utilities are often already present on a system and are not typically flagged by security software as malicious, making them a useful tool for attackers to evade detection.

Examples of LOLBins include:

powershell.exe: This is a command-line shell and scripting language that is often used for automation and system administration tasks. Attackers can use it to run malicious scripts or commands on a system.
certutil.exe: This is a utility that is used to manage digital certificates and can be used to encode and decode files. Attackers can use it to exfiltrate data from a system.
net.exe: This is a command-line utility that can be used to manage network resources. Attackers can use it to enumerate network information and move laterally within a network.
rundll32.exe: This is a utility that can be used to execute functions exported from a dynamic-link library (DLL) file. Attackers can use it to run malicious code on a system.
It's important to note that these utilities are not inherently malicious, they can be used in a malicious way if they are misused or abused. To protect against LOLBins, it is important to monitor and control the use of these utilities, and to have a strong security posture in place, including endpoint protection and network monitoring.
